In the next page - 

* Change account type to - **Individual** 
* Select your Tax status type 
* Add your Address 
* Add details about your registered ID like SSN/PAN etc. 
* Add credit card details 

> **NOTE** - It is **YOUR** responsibility to ensure that you shut down your GCP resources so that you dont incur unnecessary charges. Google provides you with an evaluation credit of $300, upto which you will not be charged. Once you cross the limit of $300 Google will charge you for the resources that you utilize. All cloud providers has the **PAY AS YOU GO** model, which ensures that you are charged only for the resources that you are utilizing. 

> **NOTE** - Ensure that your card supports auto debit. I have seen a few instances where debit cards were **rejected** as they dont support auto debit 

* Once done - click **Start My Free Trial** 

### STEP 4 - Create a new project

* The top blue menu bar has an option of **Select a project**

* Click on **Select a project** dropdown
* By default a new project would be created

* Select the project **My first project** and you are good to go. 

> **NOTE** - Google Cloud **Projects** provides a good way to bundle all your resources together. Which means that deleting the project entirely will delete all the resources inside it. This is really helpful when you dont remember what resources have been created and what resources are getting billed. Deleting the project completely will ensure that you are not billed for anything.
